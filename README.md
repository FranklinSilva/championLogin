# Challenge Login Github
A react-native app built for android phones. It showcases Franklin Silva's expertize on hybrid development techniques.

You will be able to:
1. Login with you github account
2. See your profile data
3. Logout and revoke future access

This app was made for improving my testing skills with jest. It still has work to do, since I had to stop my study.
